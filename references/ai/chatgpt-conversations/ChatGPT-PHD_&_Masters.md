I need a sound scientific method to write a journal on a specific project. Im doing a PHD in AI and digital health.

I have access to 500,000 participants on the UK biobank. I also have twin studies data with genetic and blood phenotype data, and environmental data, I also have an additional 200,000 participant genetic data only. I have all their DNA data, and I have all their blood marker data, and their environmental data. If I wanted to see if specific genetic variances or SNPs, or possibly something else that is a combination of popular SNPs or particularly high frequency variations, have a big enough influence on the small changes in outcome of the blood marker data, how do I first link the two for correlation, by excluding everything else, second how do I calculate a compensated or adjusted biomarker change I need to apply for the specific individual with a specific gene veriante or SNP or whatever to ensure that the reading of the biomarker is "influence free", meaning would I need to look at the most "generalized" healthy human, how do I third possibly focus on the biggest variant contributor to any specific biomarkers that are incredibly important "reads" for doctors that would potentially be life changing to ensure the biomarkers are actually more accurate for better disease prediction. How do I incorporate controls and I need a very scientifically based evidence model and incredibly detailed steps to do this. How do I do this?

- **Secondary Goal:** Adjust blood marker readings to remove the influence of these genetic differences, making the readings more accurate.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Identify the most impactful genetic differences that affect important blood markers used by doctors.

**Adding controls:** By clearly defining objectives, we control the scope of our study and focus on specific, measurable outcomes.

---

### **2. Data Preparation**

#### **2.1. Selecting Participants**

**What we're doing:** Choosing who to include in our study from the available data.

**Why we're doing it:**

- We have data on 500,000 people from the UK Biobank, plus twin studies and additional genetic data.
- We select participants who have complete genetic information, blood marker measurements, and environmental data.
- This ensures we have all the necessary information for each person.

**Adding controls:** By setting inclusion criteria, we control for missing data and ensure consistency across our dataset.

#### **2.2. Cleaning and Quality Checking the Data**

  - Predictive modeling naturally follows GWAS, utilizing the significant SNPs identified.
- **Before Adjustments:**
  - Assessing predictive power before adjusting biomarker readings ensures that adjustments are based on solid predictive evidence.

**Methodological Cohesion:**

- **Statistical Analysis Cluster:**
  - Keeping all major statistical analyses in one section enhances clarity.
- **Logical Preparation for Adjustments:**
  - Understanding the predictive relationships informs how you adjust biomarker readings in the next section.

**Avoiding Confounding Factors:**

- **Preventing Circular Reasoning:**
  - By conducting predictive modeling before adjustments, you avoid biases that could occur if adjustments influence the predictive models.

---

### **How This Addition Enhances Your Methodology**

**1. Strengthens the Scientific Basis**

- **Demonstrates Reliability:**
  - Showing that genetic variants can predict biomarker levels adds credibility to your findings.
- **Quantifies Influence:**
  - Provides measurable evidence of genetic impact, supporting the need for adjustments.

**2. Enhances Clinical Relevance**

  - Predictive modeling helps identify which SNPs have the greatest impact, aiding in prioritization.
- **Validation and Replication (Section 7):**
  - The predictive models can be tested on independent datasets, reinforcing the reliability of your findings.

---

### **Why Not Add It Elsewhere**

**After Adjustments (Section 4):**

- **Less Effective:**
  - Adjusting biomarker readings without first establishing predictive power could weaken the justification for adjustments.
- **Potential Bias:**
  - Using adjusted values to assess predictive power may introduce biases due to alterations in the data.

**During Validation (Section 7):**

- **Out of Sequence:**
  - Validation is intended to test models already developed, not to create new ones.
- **Logical Flow:**
  - Developing predictive models should precede validation to maintain methodological integrity.

---

### **Conclusion**

By adding the predictive power assessment in Section 3 of your methodology:

- **Enhances Logical Flow:**
  - The progression from GWAS to predictive modeling to adjustments is coherent and scientifically sound.
- **Strengthens Study Robustness:**
  - Provides empirical evidence supporting your analytical approach.

### **Step 2: Choose a Tool to Create the Gantt Chart**

You can use various tools to create a Gantt chart quickly and easily:

1. **Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets**:
   - Both allow you to create Gantt charts using bar charts and conditional formatting.
   - Templates are available online that you can customize with your data.

2. **Online Gantt Chart Makers**:
   - **TeamGantt**: Offers a free version and is user-friendly.
   - **GanttProject**: Free desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   - **Tom's Planner**: Easy to use with a drag-and-drop interface.
   - **Canva**: Provides Gantt chart templates that you can customize.

3. **Project Management Tools**:
   - **Asana**, **Trello**, or **Monday.com** offer Gantt chart features in their project management suites.

### **Step 3: Input the Data into the Chosen Tool**

**Example Using Microsoft Excel:**

1. **Set Up Your Spreadsheet**:
   - Create columns for Task Name, Start Week, Duration, and End Week.
   - Input the data from the table above.

2. **Insert a Stacked Bar Chart**:
   - Highlight the Start Week and Duration data.
   - Go to **Insert** > **Bar Chart** > **Stacked Bar Chart**.

3. **Format the Chart**:
   - Reverse the task order so that tasks start from the top.
   - Remove the legend for clarity.
   - Adjust the horizontal axis to represent the project timeline (Weeks 1-28).

4. **Customize the Gantt Chart**:
   - Change the colors to distinguish between phases.
   - Add labels for clarity.

**Example Using an Online Tool (e.g., TeamGantt):**

1. **Create a New Project**:
   - Sign up for a free account and create a new project.

2. **Add Tasks and Phases**:
   - Input each task with its corresponding start date and duration.
   - Group tasks under their respective phases.

3. **Adjust Timeline Settings**:
   - Set the project start date to align with Week 1 of your schedule.
   - Configure the timeline to display weeks instead of specific dates if possible.

4. **Customize and Share**:
   - Customize the appearance.
   - Share the Gantt chart with your team or export it as a PDF or image.

### **Step 4: Customize and Finalize the Gantt Chart**

- **Add Milestones**:
  - Highlight key deliverables or deadlines, such as the final report submission.

- **Include Dependencies**:
  - If certain tasks depend on the completion of others, indicate this with arrows or connectors.

- **Review for Accuracy**:
  - Ensure all tasks are accurately represented with correct durations and start/end weeks.

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Use Week Numbers**:
  - Since your timeline is based on weeks, configure your Gantt chart to display week numbers instead of dates.

- **Color Coding**:
  - Assign different colors to each phase for visual clarity.

- **Regular Updates**:
  - Keep the Gantt chart updated as the project progresses to reflect any changes in the schedule.
