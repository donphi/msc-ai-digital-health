Ive created an outline for a plan that I need to be able to refer to throughout my studies, its a pragmatic approach to ensuring I stay on course and within the bounds of my research. I need this plan for myself and my course leader. Its for my masters in AI and digital health and possibly my PHD, I'm wanting to actually co-write a scientific paper with my course leader so I need to ensure that my analysis and project is scientifically sound and can stand tall against the academic and scientific rigor for very impactful papers. Here is my plan. 

Please ensure that we do not exclude a single idea from this plan. I need better scientifically words but I need to ensure that is understandable for any msc or PhD student or teacher to easily read without getting tired. It needs to be clearly marked with great headings and structure, if you feel you need to slightly adjust the structure by all means please do so. I need this as a first draft for my project leader:

Telegraphing the Blow
Master’s Research — Genetic Influence on Blood Biomarkers
How much does genetic variability influence blood biomarkers?
•	I need to pull samples of phenotypical and genetic data in a dataframe or CSV file from the Biobank to start understanding the UK Biobank workflow
•	I need to understand how Table Exporter in UK Biobank toolkit works.
•	I need to understand how Docker in UK biobank works to reduce computing costs
•	I need to 
•	I need to create a specific dataframe or CSV file that includes all the important necessary fields for my research from the Biobank from phenotype data.
•	I need to research and understand which fields are useful for my study and which are not
•	I need to create a statically methodical process or reasoning method to remove fields, the assumption that more data is better might not work for my research.
•	Possibly look at weighting, understanding which fields might be more important than others. Eg time of blood draw might be the most important and highly weighted
•	For unknown fields and its effects, research and understand the more complex fields, ie, how are some blood phenotypes even derived? What is the process of the value that eventually gets derived, all the way from the blood draw to the actual number on the report. More research on this further down 
•	I need to establish if the fields that I decided upon are both available in the UK biobank study and also in the Twin data study.
•	I need to understand that these two dataset are actually comparable with each other not only in the sense of fields that they provide but also possibly in the biomarker levels if they are comparable. More on this later
•	I need to understand which DNA markers I should use in my research
•	I need to speak to Dr Corpus and ensure I’m utilizing the best scientific methodology in my approach of deciding on which markers to use, and also how to decide on which markers to use
•	I need to do more research on UK Biobank genetic data and Twin data, what is included in the dataset and what exactly does the data types provided actually do in the body and the outcome of them. 
•	I might need to do research on the omnics channels. And how genetic data variations could influence blood biomarker data.
•	Ill need to find paper on specific SNPs that currently already have biomarker influence and note these in my study.
•	
•	Restructure the data
•	I need to check the data for any missing values
•	Speak to Dr Aldraimli for suggestions on which methods to use for which phenotype data
•	Speak to Dr Corpus, if needed if there are any missing genetic data.
•	I need to ensure that the categorical data is formatted in a numeric format for machine learning to understand
•	Scikit-learn has a way of automatically doing this, I’m unsure of the library, check with Dr Aldraimli which is the best method and if it’s with scikit-learn with Label Encoder
Start with My Control set:
The idea is if we can completely remove any external factors such as environmental, time of day for blood test or even blood test upon blood test that could have blood biomarker influence we can then establish that we can continue with our study.
The only way to do this is to compare two humans with as similar genetic data as possible, removing all influential important factors and seeing if the bloodbiomarkers are infact the same between twins. I think we almost need a 80% outcome from all the twins we study that their biomarkers are within a acceptable same range. I would need to find papers on exactly how do we constitute similar biomarkers . Eg. If a biomarker is 4.5 and another is 5.1 is the variability in the difference small enough to see them as the same. I would need to look for possible scientific proof for the dissicoin on my models
•	Get access to Twin Data Studies
o	Data Preparation
	Split identical twins from non-identical twins
	Ensure that you have very clean biological biomarker
	Remove participants where they might have a disease the could influence a biomarker, 
	remove any participants where outliers environmental factors or blood biomarkers could play a role in influencing the blood biomarker
	remove any participants that take any medication that could have a impact on the blood biomarkers
	Create groups that align with certain scientifically relevant groups like age sex etc.
	Split the data into categories that could be potential influences of blood biomarkers. We are trying to isolate to see if genetic data possibly has the biggest influence in blood biomarker outcomes
	Genomic data
	Blood Marker data
	Environmental data
	Diet
	Mental Health etc
o	Run Data models across each categories to see which categories have the biggest influence on blood biomarkers.
	Blood vs genomics
	Blood vs Blood (blood biomarkers influencing other blood biomarkers)
	Blood vs Environmental
o	Run the last model on all of these factors together to see which of these sections have the greatest influence.
TWO PATHS
If we find that genetic variation has the most significant influence, we can continue our study.
If we find that genetic variation has a low influence, we can stop the study.
-	Once we can conclude that genetics play a large role in the biomarker outcomes we can move on to the next phase. 
-	This phase is to look at the UK Biobank Data.
o	We include the entire cohort of the biobank and split them into groups.
	These groups needs to address or remove variability in blood biomarker outcomes.
•	Spitting data into:
o	Male
o	Female
o	Age
o	Others, consult with Dr Corpus on which 
	We need to further create groups that group people with similar genetic vairances together. By doing this we are trying to isolate genetic variance and seeing Blood biomarker outcomes.
•	We need to then filter:
o	SNPs
o	Polygenic scores
	We need to do cross-validation and sensitivity studies to ensure that this process is robust.
o	Once we have this model we need to test it on the predictability for different groups. We have now checked how genetic snps or polygenic scores can get to a blood biomarker outcome, can we now test its probability strength with existing groups or new groups.
	By validating the strength and prediction we can effectively know the sizable influence certain SNPs or Polygenic scores could have on blood biomarkers.
-	To validate our work even further:
o	We look at the genetic variability of the twin study and try and match it as close to other UK biobank participants and then compare the bloodbiormaker data from the UK biobank study with the twin data study.
	This would ensure or give us a understanding that the processes for collecting blood with the UK biobank study is similar enough to compare it to the Twin study.
-	
-	Present a comprehensive analysis of genetic influence on biomarkers, supported by visualization, statistical validation, and ethical considerations.




PhD Research — Developing a Predictive Model for Adjusted Biomarkers
Can adjusted blood biomarkers, accounting for genetic influence, improve disease prediction accuracy?
-	Validation
o	Test it on existing models commercial or academic models

	Others
o	Test it in a clinical setting possibly a hospital or a few clinical practises.

-	Select a set of disease markers (e.g., liver enzymes, inflammation markers) where adjusted biomarkers may influence diagnostic accuracy.

The final test would be to try the adjusted 
1.	Model Development for Adjusted Biomarkers
