Hi. So, you were busy reading it, and we were on model imputation, and I'm trying to understand, just in that section, why are we doing the steps in that process?

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:12:34.964Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:12:34 PM">14:12</time>

Alright, let’s break down why each step in the **Model Implementation** section is essential.

In this stage, you’re essentially applying your chosen models to both the UK Biobank and twin datasets. Each step here serves a specific purpose to ensure that the models provide insights aligned with your research questions. Let’s go through the reasoning behind each action:

1. **Performing heritability analyses on the twin data**: This step is key to understanding how much of the variability in biomarker levels can be attributed to genetics versus environment. By focusing on twins, especially monozygotic and dizygotic pairs, you can separate the genetic effects from environmental ones, which is foundational for estimating heritability.

2. **Applying GWAS on the UK Biobank data to identify SNPs associated with biomarkers**: GWAS helps you pinpoint specific genetic markers, or SNPs, that have significant associations with the biomarkers you’re studying. This is crucial because it moves beyond general heritability estimates and highlights particular genetic variations that influence biomarker levels.

3. **Using predictive modeling to assess the ability of genetic variants to predict biomarker levels**: This step goes a step further by evaluating if, and how well, you can predict biomarker levels from identified genetic markers. It’s about testing the real-world applicability of your genetic findings—seeing if they can be reliably used to forecast health-related outcomes.

4. **Ensuring that models account for twin pair correlations to avoid inflated significance levels**: When working with twin data, it’s easy to overestimate the significance of results because twins share many similarities. By adjusting for twin pair correlations, you avoid biases that could make your findings seem more statistically significant than they truly are. This step is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and validity of your results.

In summary, each step in the **Model Implementation** section is designed to uncover genetic influences on biomarkers, validate these findings, and ensure they’re statistically sound, especially when dealing with twin data where correlations can distort results. Let me know if this clarifies things or if you'd like more detail on any step!

<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:14:35.764Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:14:35 PM">14:14</time>

Sorry, we were just reading through the process, and we were talking about imputing models with heritability. Just give me, like, what are we expecting in that outcome when doing that model, and what is our pathway with, you know, like, if there is differences in biomarkers with variability, and if not, and, you know, when do we, how do we decide that and not? And just run me through that process.

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:14:53.236Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:14:53 PM">14:14</time>

No worries! Let’s dig into what we’re expecting from the heritability model and how we interpret its outcomes, especially regarding biomarker variability in twin studies.

When we apply heritability models, particularly with twin data, we’re essentially trying to partition the variability in biomarkers into three main components:

1. **Genetic influences (A)** – These are the effects due to inherited genes, the main target of heritability studies.
2. **Shared environmental influences (C)** – Factors that twins share, such as family environment or lifestyle, which affect them similarly.
3. **Unique environmental influences (E)** – Individual experiences that differ even between twins, like specific life events or illnesses, which contribute to individual differences.

### Expected Outcomes

The heritability model, often called the **ACE model**, tells us the proportion of biomarker variability attributed to each of these components:

- **High genetic component (A)**: If this is substantial, it suggests that genetics play a strong role in influencing biomarker levels. For example, if we find that genetics explain fifty percent or more of the variation in a biomarker, it implies that this trait is highly heritable.
- **Significant shared environment (C)**: If the shared environment explains a good part of the variability, it suggests that factors outside of genetics (like lifestyle or family environment) are also crucial for the biomarker.
- **Unique environment (E) dominance**: A large unique environmental component would mean that individual experiences are the primary drivers of biomarker variability, with less influence from genetics or shared environment.

### How We Use These Outcomes

If we see high heritability (strong genetic influence), it supports the idea that biomarkers are largely determined by genes, which could justify focusing on specific SNPs (like in a GWAS) to understand which genetic variations impact the biomarker.

If we observe a high shared environmental influence, it implies that interventions targeting shared lifestyle factors could be effective in modifying biomarker levels. This might indicate that while there’s some genetic influence, modifying environmental factors could have a strong impact.

If unique environmental influences are dominant, it suggests that individual circumstances heavily shape biomarker levels, and genetics have a more limited role. This might lead us to consider a broader focus beyond just genetic factors, like looking at personalized environmental exposures.

### How We Decide on Next Steps

- **If genetic influence is high**: We’d likely proceed with GWAS or other genetic analyses to identify specific SNPs linked to biomarker variability.
- **If shared environment is high**: We might look for broader patterns in lifestyle or family history data, exploring potential interventions.
- **If unique environment is high**: This could lead us to focus on individual variability and potentially explore more personalized approaches for predicting or managing biomarker levels.

In each case, we compare the findings with data from the general population to see if similar genetic patterns exist or if there are unique insights provided by twin data. If twin data confirms findings from the general population, it strengthens our conclusions; if there are differences, we might investigate why—such as differences in sample size, environmental factors, or specific twin-related traits.

Does this clarify the pathway and how each possible outcome guides our next steps? Let me know if you'd like more examples or details on any part!

<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:17:02.343Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:17:02 PM">14:17</time>

So just quickly, so sorry to interrupt, you say if we get a high percentage of variability in the biomarker, but exactly, explain exactly how, you know, if we, let's say, for example, we choose, let's say, let's say we have a table and we have obviously twin data in that table. So obviously you have lots of groups of different twins. Why would you, how would you actually come up with, if genetics play a more than 50% role within the model, how do you actually like calculate that? Are you wanting to see how many things are similar in each twin pair and then seeing if there's a difference in the blood biomarkers? Or how, I mean, how do you, how do you actually get to that detail on a granular level?

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:17:27.350Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:17:27 PM">14:17</time>

Great question! I’ll walk you through how we calculate heritability at that granular level using twin data.

To determine the genetic influence, we rely on the **similarity in biomarker levels** between **monozygotic (MZ, or identical) twins** and **dizygotic (DZ, or fraternal) twins**. Here’s the reasoning and process:

### Why Compare MZ and DZ Twins?

Monozygotic twins share **almost 100% of their genetic material**, whereas dizygotic twins share on average **50% of their segregating genes**. If genetics play a strong role in a biomarker:

- Monozygotic twins should have **more similar biomarker levels** compared to dizygotic twins, given their higher genetic similarity.

### Calculating Heritability (the ACE Model)

The ACE model helps us quantify this. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate Within-Pair Correlations**:
   - First, calculate the correlation in biomarker levels within each pair of twins for MZ and DZ groups separately. For example, if one twin has a high biomarker level, we check if the co-twin also has a high level.
   - **Higher correlation in MZ twins than DZ twins** suggests a genetic influence, since MZ twins have a stronger genetic similarity.

2. **Partition the Variance**:
   - Using the within-pair correlations, we apply the ACE model to split the total variance in the biomarker into:
     - **A (Additive genetic influence)**: Estimated based on how much more similar MZ twins are compared to DZ twins. If MZ twins are far more similar than DZ twins, it indicates a high genetic component.
     - **C (Shared environment)**: Factors that MZ and DZ twins share equally (like family or early life environment). If both MZ and DZ twins are similarly correlated, this suggests a strong shared environmental influence.
     - **E (Unique environment)**: Differences unique to each twin in a pair. If neither MZ nor DZ twins show high correlations, it implies individual-specific environmental factors.

3. **Calculate the Heritability Estimate**:
   - Once we’ve partitioned the variance, **heritability (A)** is typically calculated as the proportion of total variance explained by genetic factors (A).
   - If heritability (A) comes out as, say, **sixty percent**, this means sixty percent of the variability in the biomarker levels across all individuals in the sample can be attributed to genetic differences.

### Example Calculation

Let’s say:

- MZ twins have a high within-pair correlation in a biomarker (e.g., 0.8).
- DZ twins show a lower correlation (e.g., 0.4).

Using these correlations, the ACE model can estimate that the **difference in correlations between MZ and DZ twins** is largely due to genetics, allowing us to calculate heritability.

### In Practice

In your dataset, you’d:

- Group data by twin pairs.
- Calculate biomarker correlations for MZ and DZ pairs separately.
- Input these correlations into the ACE model (often through statistical software) to compute the A, C, and E components.

The result will tell you whether genetics, shared environment, or unique environment primarily drives biomarker variability. This calculation gives you a concrete measure of heritability, showing whether genetics account for more than fifty percent of the variability.

Does this help clarify the process?

So, sorry for interrupting, I'm still trying to wrap my head around. We've got, let's say, give me a solid way of understanding. We have a whole column, right? We have many columns, and we have many variables within that column, and let's say we have tons of columns for, let's say, identical twins, and all those columns should be pretty very similar. Then we have, like, obviously the phenotype data, the blood data, and environmental data. Is the idea that if the variability of the genomics data is very tight, so meaning that not a lot of change, are we expecting a map, so therefore we're not expecting the biomarkers to be much different. If they are different, in a way, and they've been taken on the same day, for example, that indicates that there is variability in the genetics, or not, actually, it doesn't, because then we are assuming that, no, so if the variability is low on the genetics and very low on the biomarkers, we don't have any concrete conclusion. If, let's say, for example, there is a high variance in the genotype or environmental, but not in the genetics, what does that conclude? Does that mean that there's no environmental or phenotypical outcome based on the genetics? Is that correct? Am I understanding the process?

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:21:06.123Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:21:06 PM">14:21</time>

You're definitely on the right track, and it's a complex concept, so let's go through it step by step to clarify.

Imagine you have your dataset with **identical twins (MZ twins)** and **fraternal twins (DZ twins)**. For each twin pair, you have columns for **genomic data (genetic markers)**, **phenotypic data (like blood biomarkers)**, and **environmental data**.

### Step 1: Understanding Low vs. High Variability in Genomic and Biomarker Data

1. **Low Variability in Genetics for MZ Twins**: Since identical twins share almost all their genes, we expect very **low variability** in their genetic data. Any differences we see in biomarker levels between identical twins aren’t likely due to genetic differences, because their genetics are nearly identical.

2. **Low Variability in Biomarkers for MZ Twins**: If identical twins also have very **similar biomarker levels**, this suggests that genetics may play a strong role in determining these biomarker levels. The reasoning is that since they have the same genes and similar biomarkers, genetics likely explain why their biomarker levels are similar.

3. **High Variability in Biomarkers for MZ Twins**: If identical twins have **different biomarker levels** despite having nearly identical genes, it suggests that **non-genetic factors** (like environmental or individual-specific factors) may be driving the differences in biomarker levels. This points towards environmental influences or unique experiences affecting the outcome.

### Step 2: Comparing MZ Twins with DZ Twins

1. **If MZ twins are more similar in biomarkers than DZ twins**: When you see that identical twins (MZ) have closer biomarker levels than fraternal twins (DZ), it implies that **genetics play a role**. Fraternal twins share only about fifty percent of their genes, so if they’re less similar in biomarkers than identical twins, it suggests that the genetic similarity of identical twins is making their biomarkers more alike.

2. **If MZ and DZ twins show similar biomarker variability**: If there’s no major difference in biomarker similarity between MZ and DZ twins, it indicates that **genetics might not play a strong role** in influencing those biomarkers. Instead, shared or unique environmental factors are likely influencing the biomarkers equally for both identical and fraternal twins.

### Step 3: High Variance in Environmental Data

- If you observe **high variability in environmental factors** but low genetic variability for MZ twins, and you still see differences in biomarkers, it suggests that **environmental factors** might be causing these differences. For example, if one twin has a unique environmental exposure (like diet or stress), this might explain why their biomarker differs from their twin, despite sharing the same genes.

### Putting It All Together: What Each Scenario Suggests

- **Low genetic variability + low biomarker variability (for MZ twins)**: Indicates a likely genetic influence on the biomarker.
- **Low genetic variability + high biomarker variability (for MZ twins)**: Points towards environmental or unique individual factors affecting the biomarker.
- **High variability in DZ twins’ biomarkers compared to MZ twins**: Suggests a genetic influence because DZ twins, who are less genetically similar, have more varied biomarker levels.
- **Similar biomarker variability between MZ and DZ twins**: Suggests that genetics may not play a strong role, and the observed biomarker levels might be due to shared or unique environmental factors.

### Example Conclusion

If, after these analyses, you find that MZ twins are very similar in biomarker levels, while DZ twins are more variable, you might conclude that genetics strongly influence the biomarker. Conversely, if MZ twins show differences that align with environmental factors, it suggests environmental influence.

Does this make sense as a way of interpreting genetic, environmental, and phenotypic data in twin studies? Each type of variability gives clues about what drives biomarker levels.

I think I understand now. So we're basically looking at three parts, and which of these three parts have the most influence in the blood? Actually, we, yeah, so the question is, do we have three parts, meaning that we look at the genetics, we look at the environmental, and then we look at the biological, like so, meaning that, so we see, we compare the variance between the genetics and the blood to see if there's variance differences. Then we do the genetics and the environmental and see if there's a difference. And if we, can we, do we then do biomarkers upon biomarkers, stating that one biomarker maybe has an influence of other biomarkers, like, just run me through that and make sure that we're encapsulating all the, the entire process?

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:24:53.710Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:24:53 PM">14:24</time>

Yes, you've got it! Let’s break down these **three main parts** you’re working with: **genetics**, **environmental factors**, and **biomarkers**. And yes, there’s also the step of looking at **relationships between biomarkers** themselves.

### The Three Key Parts and Their Influence

1. **Genetics**: This is where we look at the **genetic data** (like SNPs or specific gene variants) of each twin pair. The goal is to see if genetic similarity correlates with similarity in biomarker levels. High similarity in biomarkers among identical twins, who share almost all their genes, suggests a genetic influence on those biomarkers.

2. **Environmental Factors**: These include things like lifestyle, diet, stress, or other shared and unique environmental exposures. By comparing biomarker levels between twins who share the same environment to different extents (identical vs. fraternal twins), we assess how much the **shared environment** versus **unique experiences** influence biomarker variability.

3. **Biomarkers (Phenotypic Data)**: These are the actual blood measurements or biological markers you’re studying. By examining variability in these biomarkers, we try to pinpoint whether genetics or environment—or a mix of both—best explains their levels.

### Step-by-Step Analysis Process

1. **Comparing Genetics and Biomarkers**:
   - Here, you’re examining if twin pairs with similar genetics (especially MZ twins) also have similar biomarker levels. If there’s a strong genetic influence, you’ll find that MZ twins have more similar biomarkers than DZ twins.
   - This analysis lets you estimate heritability, or the proportion of variability in biomarkers that can be explained by genetics.

2. **Comparing Environment and Biomarkers**:
   - Next, look at the environmental factors each twin is exposed to and compare them with biomarker variability. If you notice that twins with the same environment (whether identical or fraternal) show similar biomarker levels, it suggests a strong environmental influence.
   - Unique environmental differences (e.g., one twin’s diet or stress level) may also explain individual differences in biomarkers, especially when MZ twins differ significantly in biomarker levels despite having identical genes.

3. **Assessing Relationships Between Biomarkers (Biomarker-to-Biomarker Influence)**:
   - Finally, this step explores whether **one biomarker influences another**. Sometimes biomarkers are interrelated; for instance, inflammation markers could impact levels of other biomarkers related to immune response.
   - You’d use **correlation or regression analysis** to check if changes in one biomarker are consistently associated with changes in another. This is particularly useful for understanding complex interactions that aren’t solely due to genetics or environment but are part of biological processes.

### Why This Approach Covers the Entire Process

By examining each of these relationships—genetics to biomarkers, environment to biomarkers, and biomarker-to-biomarker—you get a comprehensive view of what drives variability.

- **If genetics strongly predict biomarker levels** (i.e., high similarity in MZ twins), it suggests a genetic basis.
- **If shared environment plays a big role** (i.e., similar biomarkers in DZ twins too), it points to environmental factors.
- **If biomarkers correlate with each other** independent of genetics or environment, it indicates biological interactions within the body.

### Summary of the Process

1. **Genetics ↔ Biomarkers**: To understand genetic influence on biomarker variability.
2. **Environment ↔ Biomarkers**: To gauge how much shared or unique environmental factors impact biomarkers.
3. **Biomarkers ↔ Biomarkers**: To identify biological relationships between biomarkers themselves.

This approach ensures you capture the full spectrum of influences, giving a holistic view of how biomarkers are shaped by genetics, environment, and internal biological processes. Let me know if this overview ties everything together or if there’s anything more to explore!

So that's quite interesting. So let's say we do the twin study, right, and we find identical twins have variability between the entire chain, meaning that we... So once we've compared each of these, like, sections individually, we then do an analysis, like, right through, you know, and create almost a percentage of how much could be attributed to genetics, how much can be attributed to blood, between blood, and how much can be attributed to environmental. So let's say, for example, we then establish that there's a large component of genetics that play a role in the outcome of blood biomarkers. How much, how big of a cohort, or, you know, let's say we have 10,000 identical twins, how many of those need to be perfectly aligned, or let's say perfectly correlated between blood and genomics, to ensure that we have a strong case that biomarker influence is from genetics? Is it 60%? Is it 80%? How do we decide on that level? I'd like to understand that.

<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:29:59.374Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:29:59 PM">14:29</time>

That’s a fantastic question, and it really gets to the heart of how we quantify genetic influence and ensure our findings are statistically robust.

When we assess the influence of genetics on biomarkers in a twin study, the strength of our conclusions depends on two main factors: **heritability estimates** and **statistical significance** based on the sample size and correlation strength.

### 1. Heritability Estimates and What They Mean

Heritability, which we calculate through models like the ACE model, is expressed as a **percentage**. For example, if we find that heritability is seventy percent, it means **seventy percent of the variance in biomarker levels** across the cohort can be explained by genetic factors.

- **High heritability** (typically above fifty percent) suggests that genetics are a major determinant of the biomarker.
- **Moderate heritability** (thirty to fifty percent) indicates a genetic influence but leaves room for environmental factors.
- **Low heritability** (below thirty percent) would imply that genetics play a minor role, with environmental or unique factors likely dominating.

### 2. Deciding How Much Correlation is Enough: Statistical Power and Sample Size

The larger the sample size, the more confident we can be in our findings. In twin studies with a large sample, such as **ten thousand identical twin pairs**, even a moderate correlation between genetics and biomarkers can be significant.

To decide on a threshold (say, sixty percent or eighty percent alignment), researchers use **statistical power analysis**:

- **Statistical Power**: For twin studies, power analysis often aims for **eighty percent power**, meaning there's an eighty percent chance of detecting a true effect. Higher power reduces the chance of false negatives, so with a large sample, even smaller effects (like moderate heritability) can still be statistically significant.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Heritability estimates often come with confidence intervals. Narrow intervals around the heritability estimate (e.g., sixty to seventy percent) provide more confidence than wide intervals, indicating that the estimate is precise.

### What Level of Alignment is Considered Strong Evidence?

1. **Heritability above Fifty Percent**: Generally, if heritability estimates for biomarkers are above fifty percent across a large sample, this is considered strong evidence that genetics play a major role. For example, if seventy percent of biomarker variability is explained by genetics in a ten-thousand twin cohort, that’s a robust indication of genetic influence.

2. **Consistency Across a Large Cohort**: If we observe that **a significant proportion of the ten thousand pairs have similar biomarkers**, particularly if identical twins show much higher similarity than fraternal twins, this strengthens the case. High similarity in at least sixty to seventy percent of identical twins would generally be compelling evidence of genetic influence.

3. **Thresholds of Alignment (like 60% or 80%)**:
   - In practical terms, you don’t need a perfect one hundred percent alignment, as biology is rarely absolute. But if **sixty percent or more of the identical twin pairs show high similarity in biomarkers**, and this is consistent across the cohort, it suggests a strong genetic role.
   - If you reach **eighty percent alignment or more**, it would be even stronger evidence, almost definitively pointing to genetics as a primary driver.

### Summary

To ensure a strong case for genetic influence:

- Aim for a **heritability estimate of at least fifty to sixty percent** or higher.
- Check that **a large portion of identical twins (e.g., sixty to eighty percent) have aligned biomarker levels**.
- Use a large sample size (like ten thousand pairs) to enhance statistical significance and ensure your findings aren’t due to chance.

In twin studies, a combination of **high heritability estimates** and **consistent biomarker similarity across the cohort** provides compelling evidence. This approach helps you confidently attribute biomarker variation to genetic factors rather than environmental or random influences.

Let me know if this framework gives you a clearer picture of the thresholds and how to interpret alignment levels!

So, now I want to understand is, you know, there's so many variabilities when it comes to taking biomarkers. So, let's say the time of day and, you know, how long it was processed, how long the blood was standing to be checked, how do we constitute that two biomarkers are similar? So let's say, for example, you take ALT for a liver enzyme, is 5.2 and 5.9 similar enough to actually call it similar? Meaning that how do we adjust for slight changes based on external factors to ensure that we are actually making the right call in understanding if they are correlated or not?

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:34:11.550Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:34:11 PM">14:34</time>

Great question! Biomarkers can indeed fluctuate due to factors like the time of day, sample handling, and even minor physiological variations. Here’s how we typically adjust for these kinds of **natural and technical variabilities** to determine if biomarkers are “similar enough” to be considered correlated:

### 1. Establishing Acceptable Ranges for Similarity

For each biomarker, there are often **clinically acceptable ranges** that account for small, expected fluctuations. For example:

- In clinical practice, a slight difference in ALT (e.g., from 5.2 to 5.9) might fall within the **normal variability range** and still be considered essentially the same, especially if this range is backed by studies showing typical daily or individual variations.
- These acceptable ranges help us define a threshold. We might say two values within ten percent of each other are “similar” for certain biomarkers if it’s within a clinically normal variation range.

### 2. Using **Standardized Scores** or **Z-scores** to Account for Variability

To make biomarkers comparable across individuals and conditions:

- We often convert raw values into **Z-scores** (or standardized scores). This involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of a biomarker across the cohort, which helps account for natural variability.
- By comparing Z-scores instead of raw values, we adjust for individual and population-level fluctuations, meaning we’re looking at how a value deviates from the typical value within the group, not just the absolute number.

### 3. Time-of-Day Adjustments and Circadian Variability

Some biomarkers, like cortisol, follow **circadian rhythms** and can vary significantly based on the time of day. To control for this:

- **Time-based adjustments** are made by either collecting samples at the same time across participants or by applying statistical corrections for time-of-day effects, if samples were taken at different times.
- Alternatively, researchers might include **time of collection as a covariate** in their models to adjust for its influence on biomarker levels.

### 4. Technical Variability and Batch Effects

Blood processing times, handling conditions, and lab equipment can introduce **technical variability**. To minimize this:

- **Batch correction methods** are used when biomarkers are processed in multiple batches or at different times. Statistical techniques like **ComBat** or **linear mixed models** adjust for these batch effects, ensuring that slight lab-induced variations don’t bias the results.
- By accounting for these technical variables, we reduce the chance that small processing differences (e.g., a delay in processing time) impact our determination of “similarity.”

### 5. Defining Similarity Thresholds Statistically

To formally assess similarity:

- We use **intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs)**, which measure the consistency or reproducibility of biomarker levels within twin pairs. A high ICC (close to one) suggests that biomarker levels are consistent enough to be considered “similar.”
- Alternatively, **Bland-Altman plots** can visually display the agreement between two measurements, helping determine if slight differences are within acceptable limits.

### Example: Determining Similarity in ALT Levels

Let’s say for ALT levels:

- We know from clinical data that ALT can vary by up to **ten percent** within the same person on different days due to natural factors.
- If one twin has an ALT of **5.2** and the other has **5.9**, this difference might fall within that clinically acceptable ten percent range, and we could reasonably consider them “similar.”
- However, if one twin’s ALT was **5.2** and the other’s was **8.0**, this would exceed the expected range, suggesting a meaningful difference.

### Summary: How We Call Biomarkers “Similar”

1. **Define acceptable clinical ranges** based on prior research and clinical guidelines.
2. Use **standardized scores** to normalize biomarker values.
3. Adjust for **time-of-day effects** if biomarkers are time-sensitive.
4. Correct for **batch effects** and technical variability.
5. Use statistical methods like **ICCs** or **Bland-Altman plots** to formalize similarity assessments.

By combining these approaches, we create a robust framework that accounts for minor, expected fluctuations and helps ensure that when we say biomarkers are “similar,” it’s based on reliable, scientifically justified criteria. Does this help clarify how we handle and interpret variability in biomarker similarity?

Okay, I think I understand that. Let's make a note that in my research, I will need to have some kind of journal that I reference to actually understand or maybe I need to actually find out from either a blood clinical lab to find out what variance or what changes, let's say 5.2 to 5.9, what is an allowable percentage change up or down to constitute it being the same or not.

So I want to like just so I think I understand the implementation of model based on the you know we went at right at the start we started reading and so I actually want you to continue reading from the implementation of models in the twin study maybe just back it up a little bit and continue reading it so that and once I find something I want to just pick out will work.

Alright, I’ll pick up from where we left off, just a bit before **Model Implementation** to give some context. Here we go.

### Model Development and Analysis

**Model Implementation**: The objective here is to apply the selected models to both the UK Biobank and twin datasets.

- **Perform heritability analyses on the twin data**: This involves using twin data to estimate how much genetic factors contribute to biomarker variability. The ACE model is typically applied here, dividing the variability into genetic, shared environmental, and unique environmental components.

- **Apply GWAS on the UK Biobank data to identify SNPs associated with biomarkers**: The Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) helps identify specific genetic markers, like SNPs, that are associated with certain biomarkers. This step is crucial for pinpointing the exact genetic variations impacting biomarkers.

- **Use predictive modeling to assess the ability of genetic variants to predict biomarker levels**: This part involves using the identified genetic markers to build predictive models. The goal is to see how accurately these models, based on genetics alone, can predict biomarker levels across the population.

- **Ensure that models account for twin pair correlations to avoid inflated significance levels**: Since twins share a unique correlation, especially identical ones, it’s important to adjust models to avoid overestimating the genetic effect due to this inherent similarity. Without this adjustment, there’s a risk of inflated statistical significance, which could mislead conclusions.

### Evaluating Model Results

The goal here is to determine the effectiveness of models in answering research questions.

- **Analyze heritability estimates to understand the genetic contribution**: By looking at the heritability values derived from the twin data, you can gauge how strongly genetics impact biomarkers. High heritability implies a strong genetic influence, whereas low heritability suggests more environmental or individual factors.

- **Compare the influence of genetics on biomarkers between twins and the general population**: This step lets you validate if the genetic influence observed in twins holds up when looking at a broader sample, such as the general UK Biobank population.

- **Assess the predictive power of genetic variants on biomarker levels**: Here, you’re checking if the genetic models can accurately predict biomarker levels, providing insight into the real-world applicability of the findings.

- **Evaluate statistical significance, effect sizes, and confidence intervals**: These measures help ensure that your results aren’t just statistically significant but also practically meaningful, with robust effect sizes and narrow confidence intervals.

I’ll pause here—let me know if any of these parts stand out, or if you’d like me to keep going.

So just to stop you there, so they might have a list of SNPs that we know that have a wide impact on blood biomarkers. I mean the one thing we have to note is maybe possibly looking into where I get this list to be aware of it, otherwise I'm just choosing random genetic variability that might have no, absolutely no influence.

Alright, picking up from where we left off.

### Data Refinement and Quality Control

**Excluding Confounding Data**: The objective here is to improve accuracy by removing data that could bias results.

- **Identify and exclude individuals with conditions affecting biomarker levels**: Certain health conditions or medications can skew biomarker readings. By excluding individuals with these confounding factors, you help ensure the data reflects natural genetic and environmental influences on biomarkers.

- **Apply this to both UK Biobank and twin datasets**: Consistency across datasets is key, so confounding exclusions should be applied to both, maintaining comparability between the general population and twin data.

- **Exclude twin pairs if one or both have significant anomalies**: If one twin has outlying data points (like a severe illness), this can affect the twin-pair analysis. Removing such pairs ensures that anomalies don’t distort the overall trends.

- **Document exclusion criteria for transparency**: Keeping a record of why certain data points or individuals were excluded ensures transparency, which is critical for replicability and credibility in research.

**Ensuring Data Integrity**: The goal here is to maintain high data quality throughout analysis.

- **Regularly check data for errors or inconsistencies**: Regular data audits help catch and correct any issues before they impact analysis results.

- **Keep detailed records of data processing steps**: This documentation not only supports transparency but also allows you to revisit and refine your methods if new information or techniques become available.

- **Be cautious to avoid introducing errors, especially when merging datasets**: Merging large and complex datasets can introduce errors if not done carefully. Consistent variable naming and formatting are crucial for successful integration.

Alright, moving on to the next sections.

### Advanced Analysis and Validation

**Predictive Modeling**: Here, the objective is to assess the predictive power of genetic variants.

- **Develop predictive models using significant SNPs from GWAS and relevant covariates**: Based on the SNPs identified as impactful in your GWAS, you can build models to predict biomarker levels. Including relevant covariates (like age or sex) helps control for other influential factors, enhancing model accuracy.

- **Use both UK Biobank and twin datasets to compare predictive accuracy**: This dual approach allows you to validate the model’s robustness across different populations. If the model performs well in both datasets, it suggests that the findings are generalizable.

- **Evaluate models using metrics like R², RMSE, and MAE**: These statistical metrics help gauge the model's performance. R² indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model, while RMSE and MAE measure the average prediction error, giving insight into its precision and reliability.

- **Compare predicted biomarker levels with actual levels in both datasets**: By testing how closely predicted levels match actual biomarker values, you can assess whether the model reliably captures genetic influences on biomarkers.

**Validation of Findings**: The objective here is to confirm the reliability and generalizability of results.

- **Use the twin data as an independent dataset to validate models developed from the UK Biobank data**: Twin data provides a robust test of your model’s validity, given the genetic similarities within twin pairs.

- **Perform cross-validation within each dataset**: Cross-validation techniques (like k-fold) allow you to assess the model’s performance consistency across different data subsets, reducing the risk of overfitting.

- **Compare results across datasets to assess consistency**: If findings align between the twin and general datasets, it strengthens the validity of your conclusions.

- **Conduct sensitivity analyses by varying model parameters and checking the impact on results**: This step helps you determine if small changes in the model parameters affect outcomes, ensuring the model’s robustness to minor variations.

Certainly! Let’s break down the **Validation of Findings** section in more detail, as it’s crucial for confirming the reliability and generalizability of your results.

### Validation of Findings in Detail

The goal here is to **ensure your models and findings are reliable and applicable** across different groups, such as both the twin data and the general UK Biobank data. This involves several steps to test the robustness and consistency of your results.

1. **Using Twin Data as an Independent Validation Set**
   - After developing your model using the UK Biobank data, you want to see if it performs equally well on the twin dataset. The twin data serves as a **separate validation set** to confirm that the model’s findings aren’t specific only to the general population.
   - For example, if your model predicts that certain SNPs (genetic markers) are associated with specific biomarker levels, you’ll test if these predictions hold true when applied to the twin data. This way, you ensure the model isn’t just fitting to the unique characteristics of the UK Biobank sample but is robust enough to generalize to different data.

2. **Performing Cross-Validation Within Each Dataset**
   - **Cross-validation** involves dividing the dataset into multiple parts (folds) and testing the model’s performance across these parts. A common approach is **k-fold cross-validation** (e.g., dividing the dataset into ten parts and iterating the model training/testing ten times).
   - By performing cross-validation, you test if the model consistently performs well across various subsets of the data, not just on the full dataset. This helps prevent **overfitting**, where the model might perform well on one dataset but fail to generalize.
   - Cross-validation within each dataset (both the general population and twins) verifies that the model is stable and reliable across different groups.

3. **Comparing Results Across Datasets to Assess Consistency**
   - Here, you check if the findings align between the twin data and the general population data. For instance, if a particular SNP is associated with a biomarker in the UK Biobank data, it should ideally show a similar association in the twin data.
   - **Consistency between datasets** strengthens your results. If the model produces similar outcomes across different populations, it indicates that the genetic associations are likely real and not due to sample-specific factors.

4. **Conducting Sensitivity Analyses**
   - In a **sensitivity analysis**, you vary certain model parameters slightly to observe if these changes affect the results. The goal is to see if the model’s findings are stable or if they fluctuate based on minor adjustments.
   - For example, you might tweak certain inputs or assumptions in the model (e.g., adjusting the weight of a covariate like age) and then re-run the analysis. If the results remain similar despite these changes, it suggests that the model is **robust**.
   - Sensitivity analysis is especially important in complex models, as it helps identify if any particular parameter has an outsized influence on the results. Stable findings across sensitivity tests confirm that the model’s conclusions are reliable.

### Why This Matters

Each of these validation steps builds confidence in your model’s findings. If the model:

- Performs well in twin data after being trained on general UK Biobank data,
- Shows consistent results across cross-validation folds within each dataset,
- Provides similar associations in both twin and general datasets, and
- Remains stable across sensitivity analyses,

…then you can be more certain that your conclusions about genetic and environmental influences on biomarkers are accurate and robust, not just artifacts of your specific data or modeling approach.

So this is quite interesting. So actually to see, to actually go forward with the project of understanding genomics influence on biomarkers, we first check twin data in terms of like seeing what percentage out of, you know, is contributed by, contributed by genetics. And once we have an answer that's very high, then it's, then we can assume, I mean, I guess we can assume that this works across not just twins, but actually just regular people. And so based on that finding, we then add the individual variations to find specific changes within, within the biobank. However, how do we do that and how do we ensure control? Like in the, in the twin studies, it's much easier to control, but how do we know that individual variants or changes in biomarker actually affect or which, or which genes affect the biomarker outcome? If we just have random like people in the biobank, like how do we even like know that, how much influence, because we, because we won't have, I mean, we'll have it's historical blood markers, but we won't actually know, we can't actually taste for it yet because how do we know which one has which influence? Can you, can you explain about that? And maybe I'm incorrect.

You’re right to think about the challenges of moving from controlled twin studies to the more complex and varied population in the UK Biobank. Let's walk through how we bridge that gap and handle the lack of the natural “control” that twin studies provide.

### 1. Using Twin Studies to Build a Foundation of Genetic Influence

The twin study is essentially your **initial proof of concept**:

- By examining the twin data, you estimate how much of a biomarker’s variability can be attributed to genetics versus environment. If the heritability (genetic influence) is high, you can be confident that **genetics play a significant role** in determining biomarker levels.
- This strong genetic component in twins suggests that, at a population level, similar genetic variations are likely influencing biomarker levels, even if individual variations are more complex.

### 2. Transitioning to the General Population with GWAS

In the general UK Biobank population, without the twin control, we use **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)** to explore which specific genetic variants (SNPs) correlate with biomarkers:

- GWAS is powerful because it scans the entire genome across many individuals, comparing genetic markers with biomarker levels to identify **SNPs that are statistically associated with particular biomarkers**.
- By analyzing patterns in the biobank population, GWAS identifies **genetic markers that influence biomarkers** even without a direct control, as it’s based on patterns across thousands of participants.

### 3. Controlling for Individual Variation in the Biobank

To deal with the diversity and individual variability in the biobank (where people aren’t genetically identical like twins), we implement several strategies:

- **Covariates and Statistical Controls**: We include covariates like age, sex, lifestyle factors, and health conditions in the models. These control variables help account for **non-genetic influences** on biomarkers, allowing the model to isolate the genetic signal more clearly.

- **Subgroup Analyses**: Sometimes, we might focus on specific subgroups within the biobank, such as individuals with similar lifestyle factors or health conditions, to reduce variability. This way, we can better isolate genetic effects by looking at people who have fewer external differences affecting biomarkers.

### 4. Using Polygenic Scores to Predict Genetic Influence on Biomarkers

Another way to estimate genetic influence in a mixed population is through **polygenic risk scores (PRS)**:

- A polygenic risk score combines the effects of multiple SNPs to create a single score representing the genetic predisposition for a biomarker.
- By applying these scores to individuals in the biobank, you can predict how likely each person’s biomarker levels are influenced by their genetics. High polygenic scores for a particular biomarker suggest a strong genetic predisposition, even without twin data.

### 5. Testing the Model’s Predictive Power

Once we have identified relevant SNPs through GWAS and controlled for known variables:

- We can **test the predictive accuracy** of the genetic model by seeing how well it estimates biomarker levels in a new subset of the biobank data.
- High predictive accuracy across random biobank participants indicates that the genetic markers (SNPs) identified through the twin study and GWAS are indeed influencing biomarkers, even in a general population.

### 6. Repeating the Process with Cross-Validation and Sensitivity Analyses

To ensure robustness:

- We **cross-validate** the model, testing its performance across different data splits in the biobank.
- We run **sensitivity analyses** to see if small changes in the model affect the results, making sure our conclusions aren’t overly dependent on any single factor.

### Summary: Moving from Twins to the General Population

1. **Twin data** gives you the foundational heritability estimate, confirming genetic influence.
2. **GWAS in the general population** identifies specific genetic markers linked to biomarkers.
3. **Controls and covariates** handle individual variability in the biobank, isolating genetic effects.
4. **Polygenic scores** help quantify genetic influence in diverse individuals.
5. **Cross-validation and sensitivity testing** ensure that your model holds up across the biobank.

This layered approach allows you to carry the insights from the twin study into a more varied population, establishing that genetic influences found in twins are meaningful and applicable across different individuals in the biobank. Let me know if this clarifies things or if you'd like more detail on any step!

<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:52:46.862Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:52:46 PM">14:52</time>

So, just to recap, so we do the twin study, we get a high probability of genetic variance. Then we do a biomarker study and we group people based on age, maybe sex, maybe a couple of other things, and then possibly looking at their variability in SNPs and also their biomarker influence, but removing anything that could influence it other than those things. And then, I guess in a way, seeing how much variability there is within the general population with, let's say, specific changes in genetics or variance in genetics. Then after that, we actually see, based on, let's say, for example, we have these groups and we create a synthetic group that we've encountered to use variability to actually create a way to predict a blood sample. So, meaning that, let's say we created a group, they were 16-year-olds, they were perfectly healthy, no external factors, their genes are kind of in the same pool and they have the same pool variance and they got, let's say, a value X. But now we want to just remove the, let's say, the participants and create a synthetic variability or, let's say, environment where all the, let's say, we use some columns that are similar and so on and see if we can create a group similar to the group that we pulled to predict the outcome of the biomarker. Once we have created individual groups like this, we actually can then combine it. I don't even know. Do we combine it and then we can take any individual within the UK Biobank and see if we can actually predict their biomarker value? The ones, obviously, that we didn't use before with our model, but maybe the 18-year-olds that have absolutely no effect on their, that are healthy and see how closely we can predict that value based on their SNPs. And I take it the closer we can do that, the more accurate it is that we actually have found a variability. The question is, is how do we ensure, yeah, no, I don't have a question, just check with

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:53:10.350Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:53:10 PM">14:53</time>

Yes, you’ve articulated it really well! Let me recap and emphasize how each step contributes to building a robust prediction model, moving from twin studies to creating synthetic groups, and finally testing the model’s predictive power in the general biobank population.

### Step-by-Step Recap

1. **Start with Twin Studies for Heritability**: By assessing heritability in twins, you establish a strong foundation for understanding how much of biomarker variability is due to genetics. If heritability is high, it indicates that genetic factors significantly influence biomarkers, validating the focus on genetic markers (SNPs) for further analysis.

2. **Group the General Population by Key Factors**: Moving to the biobank, you then create controlled subgroups based on factors like age, sex, and health status. This grouping helps reduce non-genetic variability and isolates genetic effects within each subgroup, making it easier to identify patterns in SNPs and their association with biomarkers.

3. **Assess Variability in Genetic and Biomarker Data**: Within these subgroups, analyze the variability in SNPs and biomarker levels to see if there are consistent associations. By excluding external influences (like known health conditions or lifestyle factors), you enhance the model’s ability to capture genetic influence on biomarkers.

4. **Create Synthetic Groups to Test Predictive Models**: Using your understanding of genetic and biomarker variability within these controlled groups, you then create synthetic “ideal” groups. These groups are designed to simulate a scenario where individuals have similar genetic profiles and controlled environments (like age and health status), effectively generating a baseline for prediction.

5. **Build Predictive Models**: Using the synthetic groups as a training foundation, you develop predictive models that attempt to estimate biomarker levels based solely on SNPs and controlled demographic factors. This synthetic framework provides a test case to refine the model’s accuracy before generalizing it.

6. **Test Predictions in the General Population**: Finally, you take new individuals from the biobank who weren’t part of the initial model training—say, healthy 18-year-olds with no confounding factors—and use the model to predict their biomarker levels based on their SNPs. This step tests the model’s generalizability and accuracy.

   - **Validation through Predictive Accuracy**: If the model can accurately predict biomarker values in these “unseen” individuals, it strongly supports the idea that the identified genetic markers genuinely influence biomarkers. High predictive accuracy here demonstrates that the model is capturing real genetic signals, not just noise or overfitting to a specific subset.

### Why This Works

- **Control and Generalization**: By building the model in controlled subgroups (synthetic groups), you get a reliable baseline, and by validating in a broader population, you confirm that the model holds up outside of those constraints.
- **Predictive Power and Real-World Application**: The closer the predictions match actual biomarker values in new individuals, the more evidence you have that your model’s identified SNPs and genetic influences are accurate and meaningful.

### The Next Steps

Once validated, this model could potentially be applied across different demographic groups within the UK Biobank to predict biomarker levels in other contexts, expanding its applicability. And yes, if this model proves highly accurate, it means you’ve successfully identified a real genetic influence on biomarkers, offering significant insights into the relationship between genetics and biological markers.

Sounds like you’re on a great path with this plan! Let me know if there’s any part you’d like to refine or expand on.

So let's go back to the reading. I don't even know, I think we're still way in the front. I need to, we need to still go through the entire reading to understand.

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:57:13.324Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:57:13 PM">14:57</time>

Alright, let’s pick up where we left off in the reading.

### Advanced Analysis and Validation (continued)

**Comparative Analysis**: The objective here is to understand differences and similarities between twin and general population data.

- **Compare heritability estimates from twin data with variance explained by SNPs in the UK Biobank data**: By comparing heritability from twin studies with genetic influence identified through SNPs in the general population, you can see if the genetic factors are consistent across both datasets. This comparison helps validate the twin findings and ensures they’re not unique to twins alone.

- **Discuss any discrepancies and explore possible reasons (e.g., environmental factors, sample size)**: If there are differences in genetic influence between the twin and general population datasets, it’s important to investigate why. Differences might stem from environmental factors, larger variability in the general population, or even sampling differences.

- **Investigate whether genetic effects identified in the general population are consistent in twins**: Checking that the genetic effects found in the general biobank data also appear in twins ensures that the influence of SNPs on biomarkers is broadly applicable, adding further validation.

### Interpretation and Communication

**Interpreting Results**: The objective is to draw meaningful conclusions from the analyses.

- **Summarize key findings from heritability analyses and predictive models**: This step involves creating a clear summary of the main insights, including how much genetics contributes to biomarker variability and the effectiveness of predictive models.

- **Discuss the extent to which genetics influence biomarker levels**: Here, you analyze the overall genetic impact on biomarkers, explaining which biomarkers are strongly influenced by genetics and which may be more environmentally driven.

- **Interpret how twin data supports or enhances findings from the general population data**: By tying twin data insights into general population findings, you can emphasize the added value of using twin studies to validate genetic influence.

**Consulting with Advisors**: The objective is to get expert insights on interpretations and implications.

- **Discuss genetic findings and heritability results with Dr. Corpus**: By consulting with a genetics expert, you ensure that your interpretations of genetic influence are sound and align with established knowledge.

- **Review statistical analyses and model validity with Dr. Aldraimli**: Speaking with a statistical advisor helps validate that your models are statistically robust and well-grounded.

- **Seek feedback on integrating twin data effectively into the overall study**: Advisors can help refine how twin data is used, ensuring it complements and strengthens the general population analysis.

So just to get back to that, you mentioned that to validate further is to actually take individual twins' genomics or genetic data and seeing if there are very similar individuals within the biobank that would end up with a similar outcome as, let's say, a couple of or two twin pairs or twin pairs and see if the biomarkers end up being the same as the twins. Am I understanding that correct?

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2024-11-01T14:59:20.692Z" title="11/1/2024, 2:59:20 PM">14:59</time>

Yes, you’re on the right track! Here’s how that approach works to further validate genetic influence:

### Using Twins as a Benchmark in the Biobank

Since twins provide a controlled reference for genetic similarity (especially identical twins who share almost all their genes), you can use them as a **benchmark** for comparing with individuals in the general biobank population. Here’s the approach:

1. **Identify Genetically Similar Individuals in the Biobank**: After analyzing twin data, you know which genetic markers (SNPs) are strongly associated with specific biomarkers. You can then search within the general UK Biobank for **individuals with similar genetic profiles** to one of the twins. These are people who, while not biologically twins, share a high similarity in key genetic markers with a twin.

2. **Compare Biomarker Levels**: Once you have identified these genetically similar individuals in the biobank, you compare their biomarker levels with those of the twin pair. The idea is to see if these genetically similar non-twin individuals have **biomarker levels close to the twin pair’s levels**.

3. **Validate Genetic Influence**:
   - **If the biomarker levels match closely** between the twin pair and the genetically similar non-twin individuals, it strongly suggests that genetics are indeed a key determinant for that biomarker. This alignment would indicate that the genetic markers found in the twin study are likely influencing biomarker levels across the broader population as well.
   - **If the biomarker levels do not match** as closely, it could indicate that other factors, like unique environmental influences, are at play, or that the SNPs identified may have varying effects outside the twin population.

This approach leverages the controlled genetic influence in twins to validate findings in a diverse population. Essentially, you’re using twins as a controlled reference to confirm that the genetic influence on biomarkers is consistent and detectable in individuals who aren’t twins but share similar genetic backgrounds.

Does this align with your understanding, or would you like to delve into any specific part further?

Alright, continuing from where we left off.

### Documentation and Reporting

**Preparing the Final Report**: The objective here is to compile findings into a coherent and comprehensive document.

- **Write clear sections detailing the integration of twin studies into the methodology**: This part involves explaining how twin data was used to validate genetic influence on biomarkers, outlining each step in a way that clearly shows its role in the overall analysis.

- **Include visuals comparing results between datasets (e.g., graphs showing heritability estimates)**: Visualizations, like heritability comparison graphs or biomarker prediction accuracy, can make complex results easier to understand and interpret.

- **Ensure explanations are accessible, emphasizing the importance of twin data**: Clear communication of how twin studies strengthen the findings is crucial, particularly for readers who may not be familiar with twin-based methodologies.

- **Use the plan to track progress and stay focused**: Regularly checking this plan keeps the project on track, ensuring each step is executed in the correct sequence and nothing is missed.

- **Share the updated plan with your course leader and supervisors for feedback**: Receiving external input on the plan can help refine the approach and catch any potential gaps in methodology.

### Additional Considerations

**Time Management**: The objective is to efficiently manage the expanded scope of the project.

- **Adjust timelines to account for additional analyses with twin data**: Incorporating twin data adds complexity, so timelines may need to be extended to allow for more detailed analysis.

- **Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and importance**: Focusing on the most critical analyses first, especially those that are prerequisites for other steps, keeps the project moving efficiently.

- **Allocate extra time for potential challenges unique to twin data**: Working with twin data can present unique challenges, such as identifying twin pairs or managing zygosity information, so planning buffer time is essential.

**Ethical Considerations**: The objective is to ensure compliance with ethical standards.

- **Verify that the use of twin data complies with all relevant policies**: Twin data may have specific ethical and legal considerations, so confirming compliance is critical.

- **Maintain confidentiality and secure handling of sensitive twin data**: Personal health data requires strict confidentiality, especially in the context of genetic research.

- **Obtain any additional approvals required for using twin studies**: Twin studies may require extra permissions beyond what’s standard for the UK Biobank data.

**Self-Care**: The objective is to maintain well-being during the complex project.

- **Schedule regular breaks to avoid burnout**: Given the detailed, complex nature of the work, taking breaks can help maintain focus and reduce fatigue.

- **Seek support when feeling overwhelmed by the added complexity**: If the project’s demands become overwhelming, reaching out for help or guidance is encouraged.

- **Remember that it’s acceptable to ask for help or clarification**: No one expects you to have all the answers immediately; seeking input is part of the research process.

### Summary

So the end goal eventually is to see, you know, if there is genetic influence in blood. So I would love to be able for one day, if doctors have a really cheap way to do genetics, for someone to come in and eventually have their biomarkers done, but then have an almost like a Python like library or something that actually adjusts their biomarkers based on the work that we've done today to see, to have a more accurate outcome and precision decision when making decisions for the patient. Because at the end of the day, it's very tricky for doctors to actually make, you know, they don't have a lot of resources to make big decisions. And blood markers is such a big influence in eventually deciding on things that I find this incredibly important that the more accurately we can do this, the better.

So, I don't want you to do that now. So, what I want you to do is, this is part of a continuous plan, and I want you to add these items in the plan, but just, so for now, just to make a point of it, so we need to find processes to actually build a model, and a constantly improved model, that when it reaches, like, when it receives a new genetic data, and it does, goes through the entire model and actually gets an outcome for adjusted biomarkers, that it actually improves on that or makes it better each time. So, I need a kind of a process of, almost for a PhD project, to actually do this. So, let's say, everything we've talked about until now, we take that as a, let's say, a master's program. I don't know what the question in the end will be in answering, but it's definitely maybe, you know, how much does genetics play an outcome in blood biomarkers? That's probably the first one. The next one is, can we improve disease accuracy prediction with these adjusted blood biomarkers? So, I want you to formulate a plan, actually, what I want you to do is, yeah, formulate a plan on how we extend from here on further.

This phase builds on the master’s findings, creating a predictive model that dynamically adjusts biomarker values based on genetic data, refining clinical accuracy in real time. The model will incorporate machine learning to self-improve with each new genetic-biomarker input, moving closer to a personalized prediction tool for disease markers.

---

#### **Key Goals and Process**

1. **Model Development for Adjusted Biomarkers**
   - **Objective**: Build a predictive model that adjusts biomarker levels based on genetic data to reflect a “genetically normalized” baseline.

     - Apply the model to predict biomarker levels in these synthetic cohorts, testing its ability to generalize predictions accurately.
     - Use results to further refine model parameters, ensuring consistency across varied genetic and demographic backgrounds.

4. **Validation Against New Biobank Data**
   - **Objective**: Test the model on “unseen” biobank data to confirm predictive power in a general population.
   - **Steps**:
     - Identify biobank participants with known genetic and biomarker profiles who were not part of the original model training set.
     - Apply the model to predict biomarker levels for these new participants, comparing predictions to actual measurements.
     - Quantify predictive accuracy using metrics such as R², RMSE, and MAE, iteratively refining the model based on performance.

5. **Exploratory Analysis for Disease Prediction Potential**
   - **Objective**: Evaluate if adjusted biomarkers improve disease prediction accuracy over raw biomarkers alone.
   - **Steps**:
     - Select a set of disease markers (e.g., liver enzymes, inflammation markers) where adjusted biomarkers may influence diagnostic accuracy.
     - Apply the model to predict disease risk based on adjusted biomarkers and compare it to predictions based on unadjusted biomarkers.
     - Statistically evaluate if adjusted biomarkers lead to significant improvements in predicting or diagnosing conditions.
