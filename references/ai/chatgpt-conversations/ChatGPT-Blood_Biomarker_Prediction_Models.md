I’m trying to determine the following for a scientific paper:

Does adusting blood biomarker readings for genetic exome variants improve the accuracy of disease detection compared to using unadjusted biomarker readings?

On of the first tests is to break down the UK biobank data into subsections, genomic, biomarkers bloods, measurement, environmental and time of the test. Then to hide, each time the blood biomarkers and see how accurately I can predict them. In doing so I need to establish a way which of these methods are the most effective and then run a SHAP test either for a single or for every single prediction I make and see where the highest weighting is for predicting the blood biomarkers, but I don’t know which model to run which would be the most accurate and which model is the industry standard for this type of modeling.

Then once I establish the biggest top levels variables and also the sub variables I can looking and run another model to isolate everything else but the levels or sub levels of the strongest prediction of the blood biomarkers, I can do this with machine learning to cluster the most similar participants together by changing the entire variable set into 2 variables and look at the scatter plot, Im not sure which model I use here, but technically I can look at the sub influences and their effect on the blood biomarkers. I then what to see if I can normalize the biomarker blood data, I don’t know what this next step would be to make it scientifically sound please help with this process

To ensure your scientific analysis is robust and scientifically sound, it's important to carefully select appropriate models, properly normalize your data, and thoroughly interpret your results. Below, I'll outline steps and recommendations to help you proceed with your analysis.

### **1. Selecting Models for Predicting Blood Biomarkers**

**a. Regression Models:**

- **Linear Regression:** Suitable if you expect a linear relationship between predictors and biomarkers.
- **Elastic Net Regression:** Combines LASSO and Ridge regression penalties to handle multicollinearity and feature selection.
- **Generalized Linear Models (GLM):** Useful for non-normal distributions of the biomarkers.

**b. Machine Learning Models:**

- **Random Forests:** Handles nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables.
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM):** Effective for complex patterns and can handle missing data.
- **Neural Networks:** Capture complex nonlinear relationships but require larger datasets and careful tuning.

**Industry Standard:**

- **Gradient Boosting Machines** are widely used due to their balance of performance and interpretability.
- **Random Forests** are also popular for their robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data.

### **2. Utilizing SHAP Values for Interpretation**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values help interpret the contribution of each feature to the predictions.

- **Compute SHAP Values:** After training your model, calculate SHAP values to understand feature importance.
- **Global vs. Local Interpretations:** Use SHAP to analyze both overall feature impact and individual predictions.

**Visualization:**

- After reducing dimensions (e.g., using PCA), create scatter plots to visualize clusters and patterns.

### **4. Normalizing Biomarker Blood Data**

Normalization adjusts the data to a common scale without distorting differences in ranges.

**Methods:**

- **Z-score Normalization (Standardization):** Subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.

  $
  z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}
  $

- **Min-Max Scaling:** Scales data to a fixed range, usually \[0, 1].

  $
  X\_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{(X - X\_{\text{min}})}{(X\_{\text{max}} - X\_{\text{min}})}
  $

- **Log Transformation:** Useful for skewed data to reduce the impact of outliers.

  $
  X\_{\text{transformed}} = \log(X + 1)
  $

**Steps to Normalize:**

1. **Assess Distribution:** Check the distribution of each biomarker (e.g., using histograms).
2. **Choose Method:** Select an appropriate normalization technique based on the data distribution.
3. **Apply Transformation:** Normalize the data accordingly.
4. **Validate Results:** Ensure that normalization improves model performance and interpretability.

### **5. Ensuring Scientific Rigor**

**a. Cross-Validation:**

- Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model generalizability.
- Helps prevent overfitting and ensures robustness.

**b. Statistical Testing:**

- **Hypothesis Testing:** Determine if adjustments significantly improve disease detection accuracy.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Provide estimates of uncertainty around model metrics.

**c. Feature Selection:**

- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** Iteratively remove less important features.
- **Regularization Techniques:** Use L1 (LASSO) or L2 (Ridge) penalties to reduce overfitting.

**d. Reproducibility:**

- **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of data preprocessing steps and model parameters.
- **Version Control:** Use tools like Git to track changes in your analysis.

### **6. Next Steps**

1. **Model Training:**

   - Train models with and without adjusted biomarker readings.
   - Compare performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC-ROC).

2. **Interpretation:**

   - Use SHAP values to understand the impact of genetic variants on biomarker prediction.
   - Identify key predictors and their interactions.

3. **Validation:**

   - Test models on independent datasets if available.
   - Perform sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of different normalization methods.

4. **Reporting:**

   - Present findings with appropriate statistical support.
   - Discuss limitations and potential implications in your paper.

### **Conclusion**

By carefully selecting appropriate models, properly normalizing your data, and thoroughly validating your results, you can strengthen the scientific validity of your study. Incorporating SHAP values will enhance the interpretability of your models, and clustering can reveal underlying patterns in your data. Remember to document each step meticulously to ensure reproducibility and transparency in your research.
